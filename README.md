# Dose-Calculator
External Beam Absolute Dose calculator using Ion Chamber &amp; Electrometer

Linacs or similar beam delivery systems have to be calibrated for their output often. Each time Dose has to be verified or calibrated to deliver the correct beam. One can use this calculator to calculate the dose and take a print of the same for record keeping purposes. The data is saved in a json file named 'Dose_DB.json'. No search is provided for past records and hence a PDF export is provided.
